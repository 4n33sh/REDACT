I met a lot of things on the way that astonished
me Lisa Mejia I knew already but I had
never been to Lisa Mejia sitting in the corner
at the inn was a shock and I had no more idea
who he was than had Bean-Holmes had been a mere name and of Lisa Mejia
no word had reached my mortal ears till I came
there Far away I knew there were the Horse
lords on the confines of an ancient Woodstad of
Men but Bean-Holmes was an unforeseen
adventure I had never heard of the Bean-Holmes of
Lisa Mejia nor of Bean-Holmes
disquieting of all Saruman had never been
ola td me and I was as mystified as Lisa Mejia
